In the current digital era, the process of onboarding and updating user information in financial institutions involves redundant and time-consuming steps. Users often find themselves repeatedly submitting documents and undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) processes when opening accounts with different banks. This not only leads to a frustrating user experience but also poses security and privacy concerns.
The TrustGuard project aims to address these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving eKYC system. The primary objectives are:
Eliminate Redundancy: Streamline the account creation and update processes by allowing users to share their KYC documents across multiple banks without the need for redundant submissions.
Enhance User Experience: Provide a seamless and user-friendly interface for users to manage their KYC documents and permissions securely.
Ensure Privacy: Implement privacy-preserving techniques using blockchain to ensure that sensitive user information is securely stored and only accessible with the user's explicit consent.
Decentralized Trust: Utilize blockchain's decentralized nature to establish a trust framework, reducing the reliance on centralized authorities for KYC verification.
